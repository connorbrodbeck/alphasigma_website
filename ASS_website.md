## things that need to be created

1. Portfolio page. This page has all 6 team members. I want it to be that when they login as an admin they can go to this page and add or delete their stocks / etfs in their individualized section

2. Admin. This button should be for when they a team member logins as admin they are granted access to their stocks and etfs and can make edits
