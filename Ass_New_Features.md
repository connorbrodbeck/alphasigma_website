## Alpha Sigma Strategies new features

## Formatting error after adding a ticker. Currently daily percentage is shifted left enough where it looks like its under type and Total Percentage is shifted to the left enough where it looks like its under daily percentage. (Done)

## Feature that allows you to click into one of the 6 members portfolio boxes that brings up a bigger screen with there full portfolio and has data visualizations related to their portfolio. (Done)

## Some people can have a lot of holdings. For example, Team member connor has 20 holdings. This means that on the portfolio page there box gets super long and big. I was thinking that the box should have the highest 5 ticker total returns. Underneath it shows there total average return or what there portfolio return % is. When you click into there portfolio it will show there full list of holdings. (Done)

## When you click into someones portfolio I like the Pie chart that is there. However instead of total return for each holding I want to add a line chart that shows there total return over time.(done)

## Add filtering system for daily return % and total return % so that you can sort by highest return and lowest return. (done)

## add the labels for the pie chart a little bit more under it so that it doesn't overlap the chart.(done)

## Figure out a system for when you close a position. (done)

## Make Sure somebody cant add their ticker twice (done)

## Make sure that if somebody makes a mistake that they can delete there ticker. (done)

## Add a leaderboard that ranks members by total return (done)
